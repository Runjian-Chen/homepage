I am now a third-year PhD student at [University of Hong Kong](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) and [HKU-MMLab](https://mmlab-hku.com/), fortunately supervised by Prof. [Ping Luo](http://luoping.me) and co-advised by Prof. [Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping) and [Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). I work closely with Dr. [Wenqi Shao](https://wqshao126.github.io/) and Dr. [Bo Zhang](https://bobrown.github.io/boZhang.github.io/). My current research focus is on unsupervised 3D scene understanding and its application in autonomous driving and embodied AI.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Automation at Zhejiang Univerisity with an honor degree for the Mixed Class at Chu Kochen Honor College in July, 2020. At ZJU, I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Rong Xiong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/rongxiong) and [Yue Wang](https://ywang-zju.github.io) at ZJU.
