I am now a first-year PhD student at the University of Hong Kong, fortunately supervised by Prof. [Ping Luo](http://luoping.me) and co-advised by Prof. [Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping) and [Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). I also work closely with Dr. [Chuang Gan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ganchuang/) and my friend [Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io) and [Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io). My current research focus is on unsupervised representation learning and its application in autonomous driving  and robotics manipulation.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Automation at Zhejiang Univerisity with an honor degree for the Mixed Class at Chu Kochen Honor College in July, 2020. I am lucky to work under the supervision of Prof. [Rong Xiong](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/rongxiong) and [Yue Wang](https://ywang-zju.github.io) at ZJU.
