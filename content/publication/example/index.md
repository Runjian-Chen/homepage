abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning for indoor-scene point clouds has
  achieved great successes. However, unsupervised learning point clouds in
  outdoor scenes remains challenging because previous methods need to
  reconstruct the whole scene and capture partial views for the contrastive
  objective. This is infeasible in outdoor scenes with moving objects,
  obstacles, and sensors. In this paper, we propose CO^3, namely Cooperative
  Contrastive Learning and Contextual Shape Prediction, to learn 3D
  representation for outdoor-scene point clouds in an unsupervised manner. CO^3
  has several merits compared to existing methods. (1) It utilizes LiDAR point
  clouds from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side to build views that differ
  enough but meanwhile maintain common semantic information for contrastive
  learning, which are more appropriate than views built by previous methods. (2)
  Alongside the contrastive objective, shape context prediction is proposed as
  pre-training goal and brings more task-relevant information for unsupervised
  3D point cloud representation learning, which are beneficial when transferring
  the learned representation to downstream detection tasks. (3) As compared to
  previous methods, representation learned by CO^3 is able to be transferred to
  different outdoor scene dataset collected by different type of LiDAR sensors.
  (4) CO^3 improves current state-of-the-art methods on both Once and KITTI
  datasets by up to 2.58 mAP. Codes and models will be released. We believe CO^3
  will facilitate understanding LiDAR point clouds in outdoor scene.
